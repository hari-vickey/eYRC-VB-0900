## ***Welcome to our Documentation***



Welcome to our documentation, we are participating in e-yantra robotics competition . eYRC is a popular competition across the Globe. Many students wish to participate in this competition, As the competition provides the platform to show case the talents of the students. This competition also motivates the students to learn many things. Also, They have set of mentors who can guide the participants and enhance their learning. Behind this the participants should compete others to learn many things to be in top position.

In eYRC 2020-21, the main focus is on Industry 4.0. As Industry 4.0 is a large domain, they have separated the domain into five themes concentrating on complete automation of an traditional industry to an Automated Industry. The themes in this year competition is as follows Nirikshak Bot(NB), Sankatmochan Bot(SM), Sahayak Bot (SB), Vargi Bots (VB), Vitarana Drone (VD). They have selected our team for the Vargi Bots(VB) theme out of these themes.

##### *Vargi Bots Theme*

This theme, concentrates on implementation of autonomous warehouse management system. Since Industry 4.0 heavily focuses on automation here the warehouse will only consist of two industrial robotic arms. As the requirements are sent to the warehouse, one robotic arm will identify the packages from a shelf and place them on a conveyor belt and the other robotic arm at the end of the conveyor belt will pick these objects from the conveyor and place them into bins. Each bin represents a destination for the package. As the packages are sent out from the warehouse there will also be alerts sent to the user via email notifying them about the package being shipped from the warehouse.

Our Team ID : VB#0900

In this theme we have learnt  ROS, Robotic Manipulation, Robotic Perception, IOT, Google App Scripting, Python and Java script. To implement the complete objective of the theme. In this documentation we have discussed all the methods , techniques and other strategies  to improve efficiency of our automated warehouse.
