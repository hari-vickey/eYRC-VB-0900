## ***Preface***


e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is one of the popular competitions across the Globe. Many students wish to participate in this competition, As the competition provides a platform to showcase the talents of the students. This competition also motivates the students to learn new technologies. Also, they have a set of mentors who can guide the participants and enhance their learning. Behind this, the participants should compete with others to learn many things to be in the top position.

In eYRC 2020-21, the main focus is on Industry 4.0. As Industry 4.0 is a large domain, they have separated the domain into five themes concentrating on the complete automation of traditional industry to an Automated Industry. The themes in this yearâ€™s competition are as follows Nirikshak Bot(NB), Sankatmochan Bot(SM), Sahayak Bot (SB), Vargi Bots (VB), and Vitarana Drone (VD). They have selected our team for the Vargi Bots(VB) theme out of these themes.

##### *Vargi Bots Theme*

This theme concentrates on the implementation of an autonomous warehouse management system. Since Industry 4.0 heavily focuses on automation here the warehouse will only consist of two industrial robotic arms. As the requirements are sent to the warehouse, one robotic arm will identify the packages from a shelf and place them on a conveyor belt and the other robotic arm at the end of the conveyor belt will pick these objects from the conveyor and place them into bins. Each bin represents a destination for the package. As the packages are sent out from the warehouse there will also be alerts sent to the user via email notifying them about the package being shipped from the warehouse.

Our Team ID : VB#0900

In this theme, we have learnt Robot Operating System (ROS), Robotic Manipulation, Robotic Perception, IOT, Google App Scripting, Python and Javascript. To implement the complete objective of the theme. In this documentation, we have discussed all the methods, techniques, and other strategies to improve the efficiency of our automated warehouse.
